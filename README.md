- __Game Rules section__

  - Once Game Rules button is clicked, it opens a pop up window. 
  - Game Rules are explained in two forms: graphic and by words, to ensure they're clear to the player.

### Features Left to Implement

- Another feature idea is to expand the page and adding more information about the game, to create a knowledge base for the game, more in-depth information about it and links to groups interested in getting together and playing in real life.

## Testing 

I've contucted website testing on the computer and mobile devices. Java Script worked fine from the beggining, but encountered a few CSS bugs. One of them was photo not loading on the background, I've looked on the web and someone had exact same issue, so was able to apply the same solution - it was about source address formatting. 

Project is build to be responsive and work on different browsers and screen sizes. It is designed to be displayed as a whole on the screen.
